##Overview of PyBer ride-sharing by City Type##
I have created a DataFrame summarizing the ride-sharing data specifically focusing on city types. Doing so to determine how the city types affect the need for ride-sharing services. Also, to determine if there can be changes made to make the service more desirable to all city types.

##Results:## 
Based on the ride-sharing data gathered of the three different city types Rural, Suburban, and Urban, it appears that the urban area does best in all areas, with Rural customers paying higher fares per ride. This is most likely due to the higher need for ride-sharing services in the Urban areas. 

######Total Rides Per City Type:######
The total rides per city type were Rural 580,968,240,341,287, Suburban 3,106,884,522,576,766, and Urban 7,919,412,664,056,093.

##Summary: ##
All city types had a peak towards the end of February. It would be beneficial to know why and if anything could be repeated to encourage more business throughout the rest of the months. Though we can speculate why the Urban area did better overall, it would give a more thorough analysis if there was data that showed how the ride-sharing services were used, such as commuting to and from work. Though drivers most likely have less of a chance to make as much money while commuting to Rural and Suburban areas than Urban areas, due to longer commutes per customer, it may be worth evaluating if distance is the only reason for higher fare cost with Rural commutes. As well as possibly setting up meeting locations that could allow for more people in Rural and Suburban areas to share in the cost of ridesharing, like bus stops. Making ride-sharing services more accessible cost wise as this would hopefully encourage more users.
